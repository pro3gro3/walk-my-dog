## 🐾 Overview 🐾
Welcome to Dog Dash! This is a web application for seeking dog walker. Even though more and more people are working from home and have potentially more time to take care of their dogs, the reality is that some people have a job function that does not allow them to go outside for a dog walk. Even when the dog owner has time, he may want to spend it on other activities than walking the dog. Elderly people could also need help walking their dog especially during cold weather.
